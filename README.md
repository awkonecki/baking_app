# Android - Baking Application
## Overview
This is the forth project from the Grow with Google Scholarship offered through Udacity.

This is a standalone application that focuses on several core Android frameworks.
- Fragments
- Mediaplayer
- Widgets
- RecyclerViewer
- Persistent Data

## Features
The core functionality of this app is to allow a user to select a recipe that they would like to work with.  The application allows the user to flow through an overall recipe description and see the ingredients and the recipe steps.

The recipe steps may or may not contain images and videos depending on the details of the recipe.

The set of recipes is static, and will be obtained by using retrofit asynch tasks.

A side feature is that a user can create a widget on their device that will contain a list of all the recipes of the currently selected recipe that the user is browsing.
